Zoomy
=====

Intro
-----

Zoomy is a "game" intended for 2-3 year-olds.  It zooms in and out on a
picture as the child moves the mouse.

Compiling
---------

Zoomy is written in Genie - http://live.gnome.org/Genie

You will need the normal GNOME developer packages and Vala 0.3.3 or above.

Installing
----------

Currently there is no install as such.  Just do this:

make

and then:

./zoomy FILENAME

where FILENAME is the filename of the picture you'd like to show.  You can
also add zoomy to the "Open with" box in GNOME to make it easier to launch
on a particular image.
